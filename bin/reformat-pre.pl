=head1 NAME

reformat-pre.pl - Command line utility to reformat <pre> blocks in HTML files rendered from pods

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    reformat-pre.pl [ OPTIONS ] [ FILE(S) ]
    reformat-pre.pl --man

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program reformats the html file(s) rendered from pods, by removing the
extra leading spaces in the lines inside
C<< <pre>...</pre> >> blocks (corresponding to Pod I<verbatim paragraphs>).
Other transformations can be applied as well (see below).

The given files are read and modified one by one, and the resulting content is
printed to the standard output, unless the C<backup> option is used (see below).

If no file is given, or if one of the file names is a C<-> (dash), the HTML code
is read from STDIN, so that this program can be used as a I<filter> or even
interactively.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 -b [ I<extension> ] | --backup [ [=] I<extension> ]

If given, the files are modified I<in-place> (and no output is sent to the
standard output).

An I<extension> can optionally be provided, which will cause a backup copy
of every input file to be created.

The extension works exactly as with the perl C<-i> switch, that is:
if the extension does not contain a C<*>, then it is appended to the end of the
current filename as a suffix;
if the extension does contain one or more C<*> characters, then each C<*>
is replaced with the current filename.

If no extension is supplied, no backup is made and the current file is
overwritten.

=head2 -s | --squash-blank-lines

It causes every line composed solely of
spaces (C<\s>) in a C<pre> block, to be I<squashed> to an empty string
(the newline is left untouched).

Otherwise by default the I<blank lines> in a
C<pre> block will be treated as I<normal> lines, that is, they will be
stripped only of the extra leading whitespaces, as any other line.

=head2 -l | --line-numbers

It causes every line in a C<pre> text
to be wrapped in C<< <li>...</li> >> tags, and the whole text to be wrapped in
C<< <ol>...</ol> >> tags (so that a line number is prepended to every line in
the C<pre> text, when the HTML document is viewed in a browser).

In this case the original newlines in the C<pre> text are removed, to not add
extra empty lines when the HTML document is rendered.

=head2 -h | -? | --help

It prints a brief help message and exits.

=head2 --man

It shows the full man page.

=head2 --version

It prints the program version and exits.

=head1 COOKBOOK

=head2 Convert a pod through Pod::Simple and reformat it in one fell swoop

    perl -MPod::Simple::HTML -e Pod::Simple::HTML::go MyModule.pm | reformat-pre.pl > MyModule.pm.html

=head2 Reformat all the HTML files in a directory and make a backup of each of them

    reformat-pre.pl --backup=.orig /path/to/dir/*.html
